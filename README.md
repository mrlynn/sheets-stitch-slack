# Stitching Sheets
MongoDB Stitch is an amazing Back-end as a Service that provides a framework for integrating services from virtually any publicly available API. I've written a bunch on this at MongoDB's Blog but in this [article](http://blog.mlynn.org/stitching-sheets), I'll share with you how easy it is to integrate data from Google Sheets into MongoDB using MongoDB Stitch.

There are two key elements that make this solution work. First, we have a Google Sheets script which runs from a menu item we add to the sheet. This script collects a row of data at a time and POSTs it to a MongoDB Stitch HTTP Service incoming webhook. The second is the function that runs when the webhook is called â€” this is where the data is received and inserted into a MongoDB Database Collection.

Here's an [example spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NOeo12Rcc09j91kQgtRiGd7vMgbB3rrIcNJRDAoBKC8/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=112239861731016170701) that contains data for my team's event tracking spreadsheet.
